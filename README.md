Beginning this project, I am coming off the UI development for the Rock, Paper, Scissors project. That was a really fun modification to a previous project, and I feel that I learned a lot about what you can do with the different query selector methods. JavaScript has been far more interesting to me than HTML/CSS, as my previous experience in C, Java, Python have given me a more programming minded brain over the markup languages.

I intend to learn a lot more about the different CSS pseudo selectors, as well as in JS, and to make mouse inputs into the screen more "powerful".
